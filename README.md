# Automated transclusion

## Objectives

- Use the transclude property
- Use ng-transclude to declare injection slots

## Instructions

In this repo we have a `UserProfile` directive, and we're using it in index.html. However, our user info is getting overridden by the directive's template.

Using your knowledge of transclusion, make our information display properly in the directive!
